This folder contains testing data for CATS-rf.

The dataset includes paired-end, unstranded reads simulated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae reference mRNA and ncRNA sequences, obtained from Ensembl Release 114 (https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-114/fasta/saccharomyces_cerevisiae/).

Reads were simulated using the Polyester R package with the following parameters:

- Baseline coverage per transcript: 1
- Mismatch rate: 0.005
- Read length: 100 bp

Reads are provided in sample_01_1.fasta.gz and sample_01_2.fasta.gz files.

The reads were assembled using rnaSPAdes (default parameters). The resulting transcriptome assembly is provided in transcripts.fasta file

To run CATS-rf on this test data, use the following command:

CATS_rf transcripts.fasta sample_01_1.fasta.gz sample_01_2.fasta.gz
