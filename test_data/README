This folder represents the testing data for CATS-rf. The folder contains paired-end unstranded reads simulated from S. cerevisae reference mRNA and ncRNA data obtained from Ensembl (https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-114/fasta/saccharomyces_cerevisiae/). Reads were simulated using the Polyester R package (version 1.32.0, baseline coverage for each transcript 1, mismatch rate 0.005, read length 100 bp, files 1.fasta.gz and 2.fasta.gz). Reads were assembled using rnaSPAdes (version 3.15.4) with default parameters, with the resulting assembly saved to rnaspades.fa file 

Test CATS-rf with: CATS_rf rnaspades.fa 1.fasta.gz 2.fasta.gz
